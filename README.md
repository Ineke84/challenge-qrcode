## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (?)


### What I learned

Not any really new things, but padding and margin are starting to get clearer (did it right te first time)

```css
.container-main {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    width: 285px;
    margin: 215px auto;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

- I have to keep practicing the basic parts of html (linking to fonts and stylesheet)
- Structuring html (when creating this readme file I learned about 'Semantic HTML')
